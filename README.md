Salary Estimation using K-Nearest Neighbors
This code implements a salary estimation model using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. The goal of the model is to predict whether the salary of an employee 
will be above or below 50,000 based on features such as age, education, capital gain, and hours per week.

Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing the model is loaded from the file salary.csv. It contains information about employees, including their age, education level, capital gain, 
hours per week, and income category (<=50K or >50K).

Usage: 

1 - Make sure you have the required dependencies installed: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and scikit-learn.
2 - Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
3 - Run the script salary_estimation.py.
4 - The script will load the dataset, preprocess it by mapping the income values to binary (0 or 1), and split it into training and testing sets.
5 - The input features (age, education, capital gain, hours per week) will be standardized to ensure they are on a similar scale.
6 - The script will then find the best value of k (number of neighbors) for the KNN algorithm by calculating the error rate for different k values between 1 and 40.
7 - A plot will be generated to show the relationship between the k value and the mean error.
8 - The model will be trained using the best k value found, and predictions will be made on the test data.
9 - The script will output the confusion matrix, which shows the performance of the model, and the accuracy of the model.

Finally, the script will prompt for input values to predict the salary of a new employee. Enter the employee's name, age, education level, capital gain, and hours per week, 
and the script will predict whether the salary will be above or below $50,000.

Conclusion
The salary estimation model implemented in this code can be useful for predicting the salary level of employees based on their characteristics. 
By utilizing the KNN algorithm and analyzing the dataset, the model can provide insights into whether an employee's salary will likely be above or below 50,000.
